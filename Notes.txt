roles have distinct victory conditions

some roles are hidden - secondary roles?

story

roles have distinct actions, distinct information

rather than having specific roles, taking advantage of the real time, free form aspect of the platform,
by perhaps having varying tasks and available information / interaction at a given time for different player.
Still keeping clear cut goals but focusing on developing a system of conflicating / overlapping goals
for generating interesting interactions. Maybe assign role names to the goals themselves.

One issue with having clear goals is that players can simply show each other their phones
and the information relating to their goal. An easy way to
avoid the game degenerating in this way would be to make the goals very simple and give the player a mission
impossible style "this message will self destruct in 30 seconds". This would add to the uncertainty and suspicion.

Furthermore any messages, public or private, sent will have a random delay in receipt / transmission.
Two fold reason for this really; mostly to prevent degenerately being able to tell who sent what 
simply by observing who's on their phone at the time a piece of information is received and only
slightly to add to immersion.

transfer info - password (detect vs transfer)
misinformation - inject wrong password
